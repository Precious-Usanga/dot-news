#Introduction

This is the official repo for dot's web application.

Dot News platform aggregates articles and breaking news headlines from news sources and blogs across the web using the NEWS API. The NEWS API can only be functional in development mode (local environment).

The app has **no dependency on jQuery or similiar libraries**, Angular's functionality is completely used.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

# Getting Started

## Folder Structure

| Name                  | Description |
| -------------:        |---------------
| `angular.json`        | Used for configuration of project specific settings. You can add external styles and scripts, change the output folder, add assets, add environment files and more. | 
| `e2e`                 | Will be used for end-to-end tests to ensure functionality for users before deploying.      |
| `node_modules`        | All external modules used are here. Do not mess with this folder, as it is auto-generated by using `npm install`.      |
| `package.json`        | Contains all dependencies used for production and development. |
| `src`                 | Contains all Angular Typescript code, assets and basically everything the end user will have access to. |
| `tslint.json`         | Angular-CLI includes an automatic Typescript-Linter, which can be configured with this file. |

## Installation

### Prerequisites
> Before we can install Angular-CLI we will have to get a few thing set up first. To run Angular-CLI we will need to install this prerequisite first:
* **NodeJS** v14 or newer

[A detailed instruction on how to install NodeJS is available here.](//docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

### Installing Angular-CLI

Installing Angular-CLI is as simple as running this simple command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`  
or
`sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`

and the package manager `npm` will do the rest.

Navigate to the dot-news folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies required by the app.

## Start Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build for Production

If you want to create a build for a production environment you can simply run `npm run build` or `ng build --configuration=production` and you will get static HTML and JS files in the `/dist` folder ready to be uploaded to any server.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
